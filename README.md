# Web Development Resources

## Hello üëã
 May this repository stand as a resource guide that will help you navigate through the Kode with Klossy camp as well as for future reference for continuing to build your skills for web development. For anyone who is not involved with the Kode With Klossy camp, you can still refer to this guide as starting points to learning Web Development! 
 
This should not be a substitute for the camp, but rather serve as resources you can use to help your learning and expand your abilities after the camp.

 ### EXTENSION: Building Your Own KWK Porfolio! 
 Throughout the duration of the web development camp, you will be building a lot of very cool projects so why not show them off? A porfolio would be a great way to showcase all the projects you've done to show off to your friends, family, recruiters, etc. 
 
See this [tutorial](https://medium.com/techtogether/how-to-make-your-first-portfolio-hosted-on-github-1e5940853fcc) I wrote on how to host your website through Github pages
