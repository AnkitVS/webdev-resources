# Kode With Klossy Scholar Web Development Resources

## Hello, welcome to Kode With Klossy! üëã
 May this repository stand as a resource guide that will help you navigate through the camp as well as for future reference for continuing to build your skills for web development. 
 
This should not be a substitute for the camp, but rather serve as resources you can use to help your learning and expand your abilities after the camp.
